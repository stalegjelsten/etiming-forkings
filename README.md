# Assign multiple courses to a single class in eTiming

When setting a mass start course with forkings in [Purple Pen](https://purple-pen.org/) and exporting them to the IOF XML 3.0 format, it seems [eTiming](https://www.eqtiming.com/no/Arrangoer-verktoey/eTiming-Windows-tidtakerprogram/ag32a264) is unable to assign the different courses to the participants.

This python script automates the process of assigning different courses to the runners in a single class. The script distributes the courses such that there are an equal amount of runners in each forking.

## Usage
